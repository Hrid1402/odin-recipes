    <p>Toasted ravioli, St. Louis-style! This method of breading and frying ravioli <br>  
        is unique and delicious. The crisp, golden brown ravioli are dusted with <br> 
        Parmesan cheese and served with marinara sauce for dipping.</p>
    <h3>Toasted Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ (25 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli, thawed</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>

    <h3>How to Make Toasted Raviolis Step-By-Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat marinara sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until bubbling; reduce the heat to low and simmer until needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl. Whisk bread crumbs and salt together in a second small bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip each ravioli in milk mixture, then in bread crumbs to coat. </li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a large, heavy pan until a small amount of breading sizzles and turns brown. Fry ravioli, a few at a time, <br>until golden, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels.

        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle warm ravioli with Parmesan and serve immediately with hot marinara sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
